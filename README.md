When selected, on the return results there can be up to 5 returns as it will find anything that is similar to the name it is giving.

The process has a 5% of not finding any result or the wrong results.

If the return results did not find anything or the wrong information you are able to manually input the information below. Otherwise, just select one of the results on the right.

After selecting the result you will see that the bottom field has popluated information according to the what you have selected.

As you can see the genre that was selected is incorrect so we are able to just delete that field and replace it with the correct genre.

Finally, when you believe that all the information is accurate just press the save button on the bottom and it will notify you at the bottom saying the song tags has been updated.
